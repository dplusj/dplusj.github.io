## Welcome to my blog page! 
I am a quantitative developer in the finance industry for many years. I'm devoted to apply the snowball approach to build something meaningful from small to big, especially in the area such as AI and quantitative finance. 

## Inspiration from Andrej Karpathy
[Andrej Karpathy's keynote talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsTeEkzO9xc) at the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2024 Awards Ceremony was truly inspiring. He emphasized the power of starting with small projects and gradually building upon them, allowing them to snowball into bigger and more impactful endeavors. His insights and experiences have motivated me to adopt a similar approach in my own projects.

## Enriching the Snowball Projects
Throughout this blog, I will share my experiences, challenges, and successes as I embark on various snowball projects. From ideation to execution, I will provide insights into the strategies, techniques, and lessons learned along the way. Join me on this exciting journey of continuous growth and innovation!
