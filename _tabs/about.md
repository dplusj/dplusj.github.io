## About me 
I'm Jerry, a passionate quantitative developer in the finance industry for many years. I'm a strong believer of the theory of [Multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse), where everything happened/is happening/will happen is a result of random simulation. To find the meaning of life in the universe where you stay at now, we need to be able to collect enough/big number of free/cheap lottery tickets to get the desired result in an incremental way. This is why I named this blog - **Incremental Simulation**. 

## Inspiration from Andrej Karpathy
[Andrej Karpathy's keynote talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsTeEkzO9xc) at the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2024 Awards Ceremony was truly inspiring. He emphasized the power of starting with small projects and gradually building upon them, allowing them to snowball into bigger and more impactful endeavors. His insights and experiences have motivated me to adopt a similar approach in my own projects.

## Enriching the Snowball Projects
I'm devoted to apply the snowball approach to build something meaningful from small to big, especially in the area such as AI and quantitative finance. Throughout this blog, I will share my experiences, challenges, and successes as I embark on various snowball projects. From ideation to execution, I will provide insights into the strategies, techniques, and lessons learned along the way. Join me on this exciting journey of continuous growth and innovation!
